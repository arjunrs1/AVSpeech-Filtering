# AVSpeech-Filtering
Scripts for filtering AVSpeech data using a vision and language transformer. The videos were filtered to select samples with high audio-visual correspondence. The filtered data was used for [Self-Supervised Visual-Acoustic Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15064).

Note: Github often has issues rendering python notebooks, so the analysis notebook can also be viewed [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/arjunrs1/AVSpeech-Filtering/blob/main/analysis.ipynb)
